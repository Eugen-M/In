The process is simple, easy, and only requires a few minutes of your time. You can start by browsing through complaints made on other companies or adding comments under other customers’ complaints. Once you are ready to write your own review, you can do so by clicking ‘Submit a Complaint’ and adding more information. Afterwards, a company representative will contact you shortly to get more details and solve the problem.
