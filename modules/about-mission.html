        <div class="about__text">
          <p class="about__paragraph">Our mission is to help consumers and companies around the world find common ground and come to a mutual solution to their problem. Besides writing a complaint, consumers can also utilize our website as a ‘database’ of companies and see their overall rating, read others’ reviews, and decide whether to use their services or go with another company.</p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">We work directly with company representatives, which offers a two-fold benefit. Customers have their problems solved quickly and efficiently, while companies can better understand their buyers and where to improve. Our platform acts as a mediator where consumers and companies can find a common language together to solve their problem.</p>
